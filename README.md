### Hi! I'm Fedir Gontsa.

Cartographic designer from Ukraine with over 10 years of experience in cartography. Skilled in all stages of creating presentation-quality maps.
You can see examples of my work in my portfolio on [Behance](https://www.behance.net/gontsa) or [my personal site](http://fedir.gontsa.com). I use only open-source tools in my projects.

My experience in cartography and related fields includes scientific publications, conference participation, and teaching. Learning is an ongoing process for me. I've been a Linux user since 2003 and have a deep understanding of web technologies and system administration. I am also passionate about and knowledgeable in art, both as an observer and as an artist who draws and sketches.
I'm a very active [OpenStreetMap volunteer](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/User:Gontsa) and member of the Ukraine OpenStreetMap community.


Research fields: Landscape architecture, Urban planning, Heritage & GIS. [Google Schollar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=uk&user=NoReOKIAAAAJ)
